# guess-number-game
User interactive guessing number game. Implemented using html, css and javascript.

This repository contains three files- index.html, style.css and script.js. These three files are used simultaneously to create a simple, user-interactive game where a number is selected randomly between 1-20 and the user has to guess it. For each time played, the highscore is stored and is not changed even when you decide to play 'again'. Score is displayed for each round, and clues such as 'too high!' and 'too low!' are also displayed.
